# Connecting your Server

To start using MC Linker, you need to connect your server to the bot. This can be done in three ways:

### [Connecting using the plugin](/guide/connecting/plugin.md)

This is the recommended and easiest way to connect your server to the bot.

### [Connecting using FTP](/guide/connecting/web.md)

If you don't need to use [chat channels](/guide/chatchannels/creating.md)
or [moderation commands](/guide/moderation/commands.md) and your server host supports it, you can connect your server in
a very reliable way using FTP.

### [Connecting using the backup connection method](/guide/connecting/bot.md)

If you have problems connecting using the methods above, you can use the backup connection method. It does not have any
drawbacks however it requires a port to be forwarded/added on your server panel or (if privately hosted) your firewall.
