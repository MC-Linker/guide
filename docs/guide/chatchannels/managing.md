# Managing Chat Channels

### Listing Chat Channels

You can list all the chat channels that are currently configured on your server by executing the `/chatchannel list`
command in Discord. This will send an embed containing one of the chat channels on your server. You can then navigate
through all the chat channels by clicking the buttons at the bottom of the embed.

### Removing Chat Channels

You can remove a chat channel by executing the `/chatchannel remove` command in Discord. The command has one required
option that lets you choose the chat channel you want to remove.
